INSTALLATION NOTES
1. Set up MySQL and memcached. We run memcached with the command:
	memcached -d -m 5120 -s /var/run/memcached.sock -a 0777 -t16 -C -u root
	This gives it 5 gigs of RAM, you probably want to set that a bit lower!
2. Run gazelle.sql (preferably as root) to create the database, the table, and the default data.
3. Install sphinx - we recommend you use the included sphinx.conf
	For documentation, read http://www.sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html
	
	After you've installed, create the indices:
	/usr/local/bin/indexer -c /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --all
	
4. Move classes/config.template to classes/config.php. Edit the config.php as needed. 
	We use http://grc.com/passwords.html for our passwords - you'll be generating a lot of these.
5. Sign up. The first user is made a sysop!
6. Set up cron jobs. You need a cron job for the schedule, a cron job for 
the peerupdate (all groups are cached, but the peer counts change often, 
so peerupdate is a script to update them), and the two sphinx indices. 
These are our cron jobs:

0,15,30,45 *    *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/php /var/www/vhosts/what/schedule.php SCHEDULE_KEY >> /root/schedule.log
10,25,40,55 *  *        *       *       /usr/local/bin/php /var/www/vhosts/what/peerupdate.php SCHEDULE_KEY >> /root/peerupdate.log
*       *       *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/indexer -c /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --rotate delta
5       0,12    *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/indexer -c /etc/sphinx/sphinx.conf --rotate --all

7. Start modifying stuff. Hopefully, everything will have gone smoothly so far and nothing will have exploded (ha ha ha)
