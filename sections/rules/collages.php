			<li> 
			        Collages must be based on fact and not opinion. Collages such as "albums that rock according to me" are not allowed. However, a collage such as "Tiny Mix Tapes Eureka! (tinymixtapes.com)" would be allowed, as it would just be a list updated from another website and not just your own opinion. Likewise, "Pitchforks Top 100 albums of 2012" will be allowed. 
			</li> 
			<li> 
			        Collages are not an alternative to the tagging system. Collages such as 'mathcore torrents' won't be allowed since it would be far more appropriate to just tag the torrents as mathcore. Of course if this was a 'xysite.com worst 50 mathcore albums' then it'd be looked upon differently... 
			</li>
			<li> 
			        Collages should not be used to create artist discographies since the artist pages already exist for this purpose, however, if an artist has a multitude of side projects then you are allowed to create a collage of all their projects. 
			</li> 
			<li> 
			        Every collage must have at least 3 albums in it. 
			</li> 
			<li> 
			        Please check to see that a similar collage does not already exist. If a similar collage does exist, please contribute to the existing collage. 
			</li> 
			<li> 
			        Please give your collage an appropriate title, and a decent description explaining its purpose. 
			</li> 
			<li> 
			        Please attempt to add album art to every torrent in your collage.  
			</li>
